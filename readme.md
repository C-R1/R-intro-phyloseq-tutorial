# Phyloseq tutorial with a brief introduction to R

A collection of scripts that can be used in a live-analysis workshop format to learn he Phyloseq R package. This was put together for a workshop on community analysis through next generation sequencing and bioinformatics at the Climate Change Cluster (C3) at the University of Technology Sydney. 

## Getting Started

This tutorial is a work in progress and I will add useful code chunks to it as I either write them or encounter them.
